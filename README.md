# MyExercisesForProgrammersSolutions
My solutions to the problems in Brian P. Hogan's book *Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills*

## The Book
Brian P. Hogan's book can be found [here](https://pragprog.com/book/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers "Mr. Hogan's Book")

## Purpose of this Repo
Created repo to demonstrate coding ability and share solutions.

## Note on Omissions from Repo
I will be omitting any and all text from the book in respect for the author. Therefore, I will be omitting the problem statements for the individual problems. The programs will be titled and written in a way where the reader should be able to get an idea of what the program is trying to achieve. If you want full problem statements, then please purchase a copy of Mr. Hogan's book.

## Tools Used
I am using gcc to compile the source.
